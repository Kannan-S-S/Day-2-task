Key Differences Between Document and Window Objects:

The individual characteristics of the Document and Window objects, 
let's summarize the key differences between them:

Scope: The Document object is scoped to the content of a web page, representing its structure and content,
 while the Window object encompasses the entire browser window or tab.

Hierarchy: Document objects form a hierarchical tree structure to represent HTML content,
allowing developers to traverse and manipulate it. In contrast, Window objects exist as distinct, 
separate instances for each open tab or window.

Content vs. Browsing: The Document object focuses on the content of a web page, 
including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript within it. 
The Window object is responsible for browser-level functions and managing the browsing environment.

Global vs. Local: The Window object is global and can be accessed from anywhere in the JavaScript code. 
Document objects are local to the specific web page and its content.
